## Outreach

I emcee for the Baton Rouge Astronomy on Tap chapter. If you are interested in keeping up with us, you can find us on [FaceBook](https://www.facebook.com/aotbatonrouge/) and all of our virtual shows are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/AoTBR). I also help to organize and set up the show, and deal with all of our speakers directly.

During the 2020-2021 academic year, I volunteered with the local Glasgow Middle School [Science Olympiad Team](https://scioly.org/wiki/index.php/Glasgow_Middle_School_(Louisiana)) to help prepare for the Division B Reach for the Stars competition. The overall team participated in the National Tournament this year, and placed 31st out of 60 teams in the Reach for the Stars category in their first year participating.

I also have volunteered many times at the Landolt Observatory at LSU for Public Nights. You can find more information about these at the [Departmental Website](https://www.lsu.edu/physics/about/observatory.php).

LSU also has an event known as Girls' Day at the Museum where K-2nd grade girls come to the campus museum and visit booths set up by the STEM departments. I organized the Physics booth for this event where the girls designed and tested stomp rockets.



## Service

I served for two years on the LSU Physics and Astronomy Department's [Graduate Student Organization](https://physgradorg.wixsite.com/mysite), one year as the vice president and one year as the president. The most important jobs of these department leaders are to collate graduate student opinions on departmental issues and act as the liaison between them and the faculty. The biggest discussion that was brought on during my tenure as president was to champion revisions to our departmental qualifying exam. Our survey of the graduate students showed that marginalized identities were both passing the exam later and having a larger mental health impact due to this exam. The discussion within the department regarding changes is still ongoing two years later, although some changes have already been implemented.
