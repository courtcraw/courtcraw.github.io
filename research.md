I predominantly study R Coronae Borealis (RCB) variables and their dustless counterparts, the Hydrogen-Deficient Carbon (HdC) stars. These two types of stars are believed to be formed when a Carbon/Oxygen white dwarf and a Helium white dwarf merge into one object, which then undergoes a new kind of stellar evolution. I am interested in all stars that are believed to be post-WD-merger objects, which includes RCBs and HdCs, as well as the Extreme Helium stars and DY Per variables. Studying RCBs is a very rich subfield, as these stars exhibit a wealth of interesting astrophysics, including but not limited to: stellar pulsations, dust production, unique nucleosynthesis, hydrogen deficiency, etc.

In the broader sense, I appreciate both observations and computations. My doctoral thesis work is in the MK style of stellar classification and thus I have a lot of experience understanding spectroscopic differences between properties of stars. I've also done a fair bit of work modeling post merger stars in the stellar evolution code MESA, which pushes the boundaries on what that code was designed to do. For more details on work that I've done, see the Publications tab!
