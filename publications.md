Here is a list of all the publications for which I've had a significant impact in and a brief description of the paper, highlighting my specific contributions to the work.

## Refereed Publications

> R Coronae Borealis Star Evolution: Simulating 3D Merger Events to 1D Stellar Evolution Including Large-scale Nucleosynthesis (2021) B. Munson et al. ApJ, Vol 911, Issue 2, id.103

In this work, my colleague, Brad, was able to transfer a 3D hydrodynamical model of a double white dwarf merger into the MESA 1D framework and evolve the post-merger-object into the RCB region of the HR diagram. This is the first work of its kind. I assisted in making sure the abundances for the resultant model were consistent with other RCBs and RCB models.

> Modelling R Coronae Borealis stars: effects of He-burning shell temperature and metallicity (2020) Courtney L. Crawford et al. MNRAS, Vol 498, Issue 2, p.2912-2924

I created 18 MESA models of double white dwarf post-merger objects, where we varied the temperature of the helium burning shell and the metallicity of the star. Through this, we were able to explore how the parameters of a double white dwarf merger will effect the evolution of the resultant star. Additionally, I was able to figure out that the reason RCB stars show partial helium burning products on their surfaces was because of a unique pattern in the convection of the envelope of the star. This same result was shown later in a different type of model, implying that this is likely inherent to the evolution of the post-merger-object and not specific to the type of model that we created.

> Modelling R Coronae Borealis stars: effects of He-burning shell temperature and metallicity (2020) M. Kilic et al. MNRAS, Vol 482, Issue 1, p.965-979

This was an improved version of my undergraduate thesis at the University of Oklahoma. Through fitting the SEDs of the coolest white dwarfs in the local solar neighborhood, we were able to get an estimate of the temperature and age of the star, which gives us estimates for the age of the Galactic population for which that star belongs.

## In Preparation

> Spectral Classification System for R Coronae Borealis Stars and Hydrogen-Deficient Carbon Stars (2022, in prep.) Courtney L. Crawford et al.

This is my doctoral thesis! It's still in preparation, however I can explain a bit about how it works. In the same style as the MK stellar classification system we all know (e.g. OBAFGKM classifications), I've created a stellar classification system for RCB and HdC stars. The main dimension appears to be correlated with temperature, similar to how the MK system works for oxygen rich stars and for carbon stars. The spectra are actually remarkably similar, so be sure to check this out in the spring of 2022 when it breaks on the ArXiv!

> The dawn of a new era for dustless HdC stars with GAIA eDR3 (2021, in prep.) P. Tisserand et al. 

My close collaborator, Patrick Tisserand, created a new method of discovering HdC stars using IR colors and therefore we were able to discover 27 new HdC stars and 2 new EHe stars! This is really exciting as these are very rare subclasses of stars. My specific contribution to this paper was to view all of the candidate spectra and confirm whether or not they were members of the HdC or EHe class. 

> Peculiar R Coronae Borealis Stars: Strontium-Rich Stars and the s-Process (2021, in prep.) Courtney L. Crawford et al.

In this work I looked at all of the spectra we have collected of the RCB and HdC stars and discovered a subclass of these stars which show strongly enhanced Strontium spectral features. Three of these stars have the strongest Strontium lines of any known stars. I also explored the potential reason behind the unique s-processing that would have had to occur in these stars.
