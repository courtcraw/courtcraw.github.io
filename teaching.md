title: Teaching & Supervision
---


My teaching and supervision activities focus on student research and mentoring. Since 2022, I was the primary supervisor for 11 undergraduate and two Honours students and I am currently co-supervisor for two PhD students. I have supervised a total of 19 undergraduates and 3 Honours students. In Sem 1 2026 I will be acting as lead-supervisor for a new incoming PhD student. I also contribute to course design and delivery within the USyd School of Physics.

## Courses Taught / Developed

- **OLES1603: Astronomy: Exploring the Universe** *(in development for Sem 1 2026, USyd)*  
  Developed outline slides for the stars and galaxies lectures and participated in curriculum planning meetings.

- **OLET1638: Astronomy from Stars to Black Holes** *(Sem 1 2025 April Intensive, USyd)*  
  Lectured for this four-session intensive course, substantially revising provided materials to align with updated quizzes.

- **OLET1636: Astronomy from Earth to Exoplanets** *(Sem 1 2025 March Intensive, USyd)*  
  Lectured for this four-session intensive course, substantially revising provided materials to align with updated quizzes.

- **PHYS2014/PHYS2914: Data Science in Astronomy** *(2 lectures, USyd, 2024 Sem 2)*  
  Assisted in developing materials for a new data science course, and designed and delivered two lectures and labs on clustering techniques applied to stellar variability.

- **ASTR 1109: Stellar Astronomy Lab** *(4 semesters, LSU)*  
  Sole instructor for four semesters. Developed four new labs, managed all curriculum and assessment, and received strong student feedback.
