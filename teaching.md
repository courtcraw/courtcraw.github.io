title: Teaching & Supervision
---

As a postdoc, I have not had as many opportunities to teach courses as I would like, however I have supplemented this teaching work by supervising many students. These two are by far some of the most rewarding aspects of academic work.

## Supervision

Below is a list of students who I have supervised at USyd, their level and project summaries, ordered from most recent to least recent.

Current Students:
* Jasmyn Curry (Second Year SSP, sole-supervisor) - Spectroscopy of pulsations in RCB stars
* Josh Ferguson (Second Year SSP, sole-supervisor) - Dipole mode suppression in the Kepler red giant sample
* George Feng (Second Year SSP, co-supervisor with Tim Bedding) - A red giant in the Pleiades cluster
* Haonan Li (Honours student, sole-supervisor) - Anamolous peaks and potential tertiary systems found via Kepler oscillating star data
* K.R. Sreenivas (PhD Student, co-supervisor with Tim Bedding) - Asteroseismology of red giants
* Lea Schimak (PhD Student, co-supervisor with Tim Bedding) - Asteroseismology of binary red giants

Past Students:
* Nikita Nikultsev (Honours student, sole-supervisor) - Merging With MESA: Modelling DY Pers by Fusing White Dwarfs (**soon to be published**)
* Maxwell Bennett (Honours student, co-supervisor with Tim Bedding) - Photometry in Crowded Stellar Fields with NASA’s TESS Mission
* Noah Smith & Nayan Gallego Sivaraman (First Year SSP, co-supervisor with Helen Johnston) - Analysis of the emission from Low Mass X-ray Binary A0620-00 over 6 years (**soon to be published**). I've got some Python teaching materials available publicly [here](https://github.com/courtcraw/SSP-2023).
* Caleb Clark (Second Year SSP, sole-supervisor) - An automated pipeline to find RCB dust declines (**soon to be published**)
* Amelie Read (Summer Project, co-supervior with Tim Bedding and Ben Montet) - Searching the Gaia and TESS data for delta Scuti stars (**has been published**)
* Yifan Chen (Third Year Dalyell, co-supervisor with Tim Bedding and Yaguang Li) - Automated detection and refinement of asteroseismic parameters in 16,000 stars
* Alexander Jephtha (First Year SSP, co-supervisor with Tim Bedding and Yaguang Li) - A search for oscillating wide binaries
* Cameron Davidson (First Year SSP, co-supervisor with Tim Bedding and Yaguang Li) - Verifying the low-mass kepler red giants


## Teaching

In my graduate career, I had the pleasure of teaching one of our Astronomy Lab courses for four semesters. This lab course specifically focused on stars, planets, and a little bit of cosmology. I developed most of the course material for this laboratory. If you are interested, you can explore the laboratory materials that I compiled and a sample of some of my teaching videos on this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eqg4oOtF_JjuCv4kwptZvIgejM3dG0OY?usp=sharing).

## Teaching Philosophy Statement

#### Below is simply a copy of my general teaching philosophy statement

Being a scientist is to be a student of the universe. Those of us who dedicate our lives to research are also dedicating our lives to learning, and our teacher is not always the most forthcoming. Our job, then, is to take what we have learned and teach it to others, be it through writing up our work or through a more traditional classroom setting. For me personally, passing on the information I have learned is the most rewarding part of the scientific process. 

I have been lucky to retain my childlike wonder for space, and one of my primary goals when teaching students is to remind them of theirs. As I've seen in physics education research and in my course evaluations, students tend to mirror the enthusiasm of their teachers and peers in the classroom, and therefore sharing my genuine passion of the subject material makes an impact on how the students feel about the material as well. When students are truly interested in the course material, they retain more information and more actively participate in their own learning experience. Instilling interest in astronomy can be aided with the usage of campus facilities such as those that provide hands-on experience doing astronomy. These will in turn make student more interested in the material, and help them solidify the knowledge they've gained in a course.

Students in general do not all learn or think in the same way, and therefore it would be futile to try to reach all students using only one teaching method. I find that while a traditional lecture is sometimes useful and necessary, it must be supplemented with other active learning methods. A personal favorite example of mine is to allow students to experience science the way that researchers do, such as by asking students to create and defend their own categorizations of stellar spectra or galaxy morphology before going over these topics in the course. The students thus interact with the information in their own way, and more importantly are given the opportunity afterwards to reflect on the differences between their method and the customary one. Students then feel more comfortable defending their viewpoints and often more comfortable changing their viewpoints. These are both crucial aspects of the way that modern science is performed, as it often takes multiple discussions and revisions to arrive at a theory that the community agrees upon. These skills help to personalize the course material and to humanize the science that is being done. 

Just as teaching methods must be varied, I believe that grading and evaluation methods must also be varied to ensure an accessible classroom that embraces diversity. There is a plethora of education research being published that can help to reduce inequities in the classroom with very simple-to-implement recommendations, which I intend to keep up with. For example, an Ohio State University study found that inequities such as the gender and racial grade gap in introductory physics can be reduced solely by changing the grade weighting such that exam and non-exam activities are weighted equally. These types of recommendations are trivial to implement in future courses. In addition, I feel it is important to freely and proactively offer accommodations to students such as alternative examination or discussion methods, as these make the course more accessible to students, and ensure that these accommodations aren't treated as an afterthought. Keeping up with contemporary research that specifically targets diversity in the classroom is one thing I feel is paramount to being an effective teacher.

In my time at Louisiana State University, I spent my first two years teaching one of the two astronomy lab courses offered. The lab that I taught focused specifically on topics that lie outside our own solar system, namely on stars, galaxies, and some cosmology. I helped to develop some of the lab materials for this course, including laboratory assignments on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, stellar spectral classification, and gravitational waves. In addition, I volunteered with a local middle school to help teach their students about astronomy for the national Science Olympiad competition, I organized a physics demonstration booth at Girls' Day at the Museum where first grade girls designed and tested stomp rockets, and I emcee for our local Astronomy on Tap chapter. All of these experiences have helped me to hone my skills in presenting science information to audiences that aren't inherently familiar with the topics. While I am capable of teaching any field of astronomy or physics with proper preparation, I am especially qualified to teach courses that involve stellar astronomy, as that is where my research and the majority of my teaching experience have been. Additionally, I have significant research experience in both computational and observational aspects of astronomy, and therefore am qualified to teach those as well. 

For me, teaching students is by far the most rewarding part of doing science. As much as I love to learn about the universe, ultimately that is all for naught if I do not share that knowledge with others. Sharing my passion for astronomy and physics with students is very important to me, and something I would not hesitate to spend every day doing. My hope is that I will be able to foster genuine interest in science, and if I am able to do that with even one student, I will have left the world better than I found it.
